            <div class="quote"><p>“I worked with Ryan during 2022 – he was a recruitment consultant at Hoxhunt, and worked across a broad spectrum of roles – including Tech, Support, Product, and Data. Ryan brings a huge amount of experience to the table, and is highly adaptable due to his experience recruiting in a lot of different markets around the world, with his deep experience in the US market having helped Hoxhunt find talent that is often overlooked by others. As if Ryan’s ability in the US market wasn’t enough, he is also highly adept at sourcing difficult and niche roles in the Finnish market, and I have no doubt that given other regions to work on, he would also rapidly succeed."</p>
                <p>"I really hope to get to work with Ryan again in the future – his kindness, wit, and ability to easily to explain complex concepts make him a fantastic colleague, and a brilliant recruiter!”</p>
